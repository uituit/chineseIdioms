# Chinese Idioms

The Chinese University of Hong Kong cosolidated the headwords of 6 dictionaries of Chinese Idioms (aka Chengyu) in the [Multi-function Chinese Character Database](https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/) website. The data itself can serve as a cornerstone for further development/research, however there is no API call to their database which made usage limited.

A webscrper was built to capture the data into a csv and further converted to json, making the information more accessible.
